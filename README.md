# Android Gaming OS

A specialized Android OS distribution focused on optimizing performance and features for mobile gaming experiences. This project aims to create a gaming-centric Android environment that can run on PCs through virtualization (VirtualBox) and containerization (Docker).

## Project Goals

- Optimize Android for gaming performance
- Reduce input latency and improve frame rates
- Enhance battery efficiency during gaming sessions
- Provide gaming-specific features and tools
- Support running on various platforms (native, VirtualBox, Docker)

## Project Structure

The project follows the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) structure with additional gaming-focused components:

- `build/`: Build system files and configurations
- `device/`: Device-specific configurations
- `frameworks/`: Core Android frameworks with gaming optimizations
- `hardware/`: Hardware abstraction layer
- `packages/`: Applications and services
  - `apps/GameMode/`: Gaming mode application
  - `apps/PerformanceOptimizer/`: Performance optimization tools
- `system/`: Core system components
- `vendor/`: Vendor-specific components

## Getting Started

Instructions for building and running the Android Gaming OS will be added soon.
